This is long overdue.

I have been putting off starting a coding blog for as long as I can remember. I am not sure why. At this point, it does not matter. It is just time to do it. Time to share my ideas and learn in the open.

My first project is something I have been working on for a while. I think some there may be some who can benefit from this, or maybe not. Either way, it is interesting to me.

[A Scala and Akka implementation of the Modbus protocol](https://github.com/kylefitch/modbus-tcp-akka).

My goal is to have it running efficiently on a BeagleBone Black. After that, I would like to add a web based configuration utility.
